# Open-Street-Map-SQL-Project

The purpose of this project is to obtain an OSM / XML file housing all data for a given location. The goal with the data is to identify data elements that need to be cleaned, determine a path to programmatically clean identified data, convert the OSM / XML data to CSV files, load CSV data into a SQL database (and the applicable SQL tables), and be able to execute SQL queries against those tables to validate everything worked as expected.
